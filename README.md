### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€˜m still fairly new to programming. Doing it more seriously, for a little more then a year now.

My knowledge is on intermediate level.

I know Javascript, Java, Bash, Python, Powershell, Swift. Sorted in ascending order to my knowledge.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my Lebenskalender App
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning:
  -  React
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about: Anything you like.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm good with dialects, when I'm in the mood.
